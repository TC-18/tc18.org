<p>A  long  term   purpose  of  the   TC18 web    page was   to encourage
collaborations between researchers  in the Discrete Geometry field. We
are pleased to announce a new structure on the TC18 webpages: the TC18
challenges. The idea is to provide benchmarks and references to obtain
comparative   evaluations     of   classical  problems  in    Discrete
Geometry.</p>

<p>To create a new challenge, contact the TC18 chairs.</p>

<!-- Existing challenges: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li><a href="Challenges/DPSRecognition"> Comparative    Evaluation   of  Digital  Plane  Segment  Recognition -->
<!-- 		Algorithms</a> -->
