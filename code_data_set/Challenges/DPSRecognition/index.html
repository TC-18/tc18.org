	      <h2>Challenge "Comparative    Evaluation   of  Digital  Plane  Segment  Recognition
		Algorithms"</h2>


<h3> Objective</h3>

<p>In  discrete geometry  various  definitions and  properties  of linear
structures --  such as straight  lines, planes, or hyperplanes -- have
been  proposed.  On  this   basis,  computational efficient   analytic
characterizations of   these objects  have   been  obtained.  In  many
applications one considers a reverse problem: given a set of pixels or
(hyper)voxels, decide    if it is   a portion  of   a discrete line or
(hyper)plane.  For this, a recognition algorithm is needed.</p>

<p>In dimension two, the  arithmetic structure of discrete straight lines
(DSL) has been exploited to design efficient algorithms, as both their
asymptotic  computational cost   and  practical efficiency  have  been
studied.  In  higher  dimension, similar arithmetic  structures  still
exist   in digital planes    and  hyperplanes.  However,  to   solve a
recognition  problem,  one  usually   adapts algorithms   from  linear
programming (LP) or computational geometry (CG). As  a rule,
there is a gap between the theoretical time complexity bounds obtained
for linear  programming or   computational geometry problems  and  the
practical efficiency of   these algorithms  when applied to   discrete
objects.   Indeed, one can  observe  that the existing time complexity
bounds are not tight when experimental analysis is performed.</p>

<p>The objective of the challenge  is to provide  both DPS generators and
frameworks   to compare the existing  recognition  algorithms.</p>
