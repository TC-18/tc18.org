<h1>Data sets and Code section</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The aim of this web page is to provide data sets and elementary codes
to researchers working on discrete geometry. The idea is to make it
easy for the community to try our own algorithms on the same image
examples as other researchers, as well as to try the algorithms of
other researchers.
Several sections are presented in this web page:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#data">Data sets</a>: 2D and 3D images (binary,
grayscale,...)
  </li>
  <li> <a href="#demos"> Demos</a>: online demonstrators of DG
  algorithms and applications.
  </li>
  <li> <a href="#code"> Code Repository</a>: simple codes from
researchers to researchers.
  </li>
  <li> <a href="#algcomp"> Algorithm comparisons</a>: in order to make
comparisons easiest.
  </li>
  <li> <a href="#tools"> Tools avaliable on the web</a>: links to
useful tools.
  </li>
  <li> <a href="#submit"> Submit your own data/code</a>: how to submit
a code ? How to submit the results of your own algorithm on our data
sets ?...
  </li>
</ul>

 Please fill free to submit your own code. In order to
make a better use of your programs, a good way is to organize it in a
K.I.S.S. way (<i>Keep It Simple and Stupid</i>). The idea is to propose
simple codes, easy to compile and to easy to reuse.

<a class="name" name="challenges"></a><h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>A  long  term   purpose  of  the   TC18 web    page was   to encourage
collaborations between researchers  in the Discrete Geometry field. We
are pleased to announce a new structure on the TC18 webpages: the TC18
challenges. The idea is to provide benchmarks and references to obtain
comparative   evaluations     of   classical  problems  in    Discrete
Geometry.</p>

<p>To create a new challenge, contact the TC18 chairs.</p>

<!-- Existing challenges: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li><a href="Challenges/DPSRecognition"> Comparative    Evaluation   of  Digital  Plane  Segment  Recognition -->
<!-- 		Algorithms</a> -->
<!-- </ul> -->


<h2>Tools on the web</h2>
<a class="name" name="tools"></a>
<ul>
  <li> Visualization tools
</a>
<ul>
      <li><a href="code.php">QVox</a>: A 3d
volumetric data visualizer written by S&eacute;bastien Fourey (see the
TC18 code web page). </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.geomview.org/">Geomview</a>: an simple
interactive 3D viewing program for Unix. Major advantages are : easy to
use input format (close to VRML), postscript snapshots, export to VRML.
See the <a href="3D_images.php">3-D data code web page for snapshots.</a>
      </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.web3d.org/">VRML</a>: web based
visualization tool. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Computational Geometry tools
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.qhull.org/">qhull</a>
: Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site Delaunay
triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It runs in 2-d,
3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements the Quickhull algorithm
for computing the convex hull. Qhull handles roundoff errors from
floating point arithmetic. It computes volumes, surface areas, and
approximations to the convex hull. Export to <i>Geomview</i>
avaliable. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/">Computational Geometry
center</a>: useful links and tools about computational geometry.
      </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Submission process</h2>
<a class="name" name="submit"></a>By now, no automatic submission process have been set
  up. If you want
  to submit something, send a mail to webmasters (see below) that
  contains an URL to your materials. <font color="red">Please do not
    send
    directly your data by e-mail</font>.
