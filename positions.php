<li><b>PhD</b>: PreDoc position for PhD, asap, 25h contract for 4 years. </li>
<li> Official announcement available <a href="here http://www.prip.tuwien.ac.at/jobs/openpositions.php">here</a></li>
<li>Team: www.prip.tuwien.ac.at</li>
<li>job: teaching bachelor and master courses; 
basic and applied research in pattern recognition and image processing with focus on hierarchical and structural methods and representations; publishing results at high-level workshops, conferences and journals.

    <h3>Postdoctoral position in Computer Sciences and Image Analysis </h3>
    
    <dd> This position is to support the scientific effort of the
TIMES project (“High-performance processing techniques for mapping and
monitoring environmental changes from massive, heterogeneous and high
frequency data times series”), recently funded by the French Agency
for Research (ANR) for the period 2018–2021. The project aims to
support the analysis of satellite image time series in order to
monitor the dynamics of our Planet, its land-cover and land-use. The
postdoctoral position covers the image processing part of the project,
with the main mission of developing and validating novel image
analysis methods dedicated to environmental monitoring of landscape
objects (e.g. coastal erosion, surface deformation, land cover
changes) from the exploitation of the mass of available heterogeneous
geospatial data (aerial and satellite images, point cloud data)
acquired with very-high temporal frequency.  The ANR TIMES project is
a collaboration between recognized teams in Computer Sciences (LIPADE,
MIPS, MONASH (Australia) and SERTIT-ICUBE), possessing expertise in
image analysis, pattern recognition, machine learning and high
performance computing, and in environmental geography (land cover/use
change analysis) with LIVE and ICUBE-SERTIT. The enrolled researcher
will work in LIPADE laboratory and closely collaborate with the
different labs of the consortium with potential travels to visit the
other teams.
