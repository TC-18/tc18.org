Dear all,

Please find below a newsletter from TC18. This letter contains pretty important information concerning the future of our TC. Feel free to contact us if you have any remark or question. 

This is our last newsletter as TC18 chairs. Thank you to all of you for your support and your help in making our community such a great one. It was a pleasure to serve for the DG community for these past four years, and we wish all the best to the new team !

Wishing you a pleasant reading and happy holidays,
Best regards,
Isabelle, Rocio and Partha.

================================================ 

1. TC18 - IAPR
 

	a. Final report for the 2014-2016 report

As usual, and to answer an IAPR request, we wrote a short report to summarize what happened in the TC18 sphere over the last two years. This report is enclosed in this email, and may also be found on TC18 website, together with older reports http://www.tc18.org/org.php. The last part of the report (recommendation for TC18 leadership) is already outdated, see next paragraph. 

	 b. Expansion of scope and board renewal

As many of you know, DG and Mathematical Morphology communities have longstanding scientific relationships, in terms of people, domain expertise, areas of interest, and events.  
MM researchers, represented by the ISMM steering committee, are willing to be part of a Technical Committee of the IAPR. Getting the IAPR to create a new TC seemed to be complicated, and after exchanging with all parties involved, we asked the IAPR to expand the scope of TC18 in order to include MM. The matter was discussed and endorsed by the IAPR during ICPR last week (December, 4-8). 

From now on, TC18 is the Technical committee on Discrete Geometry and Mathematical Morphology. 

This happens at the same time as the TC18 leadership board renewal. In this context of expansion of scope, the board composition is balanced between DG and MM researchers, as follows: 
- Bertrand Kerautret, chair;
- Michael Wilkinson, vice-chair;
- Arindam Biswas, Andrea Frosini, Georgios Ouzounis, Hugues Talbot: members, dedicated to specific tasks, such as the newsletter, the website, data and code repositories, or industrial relations. 

The website, mailing list, etc will be updated soon accordingly.

3. Miscellaneous

The list of DG papers published in 2015 has been (finally) completed. We also collected the 2016 papers (see attached files - and also on the website http://www.tc18.org/educational.php#materials).   

Last, don’t forget our image data base, code repository, image gallery and open problems list if you have new data to submit !
