1. 12th DGCI conference

As you certainly know, the 12th DGCI conference will take place in 
Poitiers (France) from 13-15 April 2005.
The acceptance notification are on the way (53 papers have been submitted).

Peter Veelaert (from Hogeschool Gent, Dept. INWE, Bergium) and 
Jean-Pierre Guédon (from the University of Nantes - Nantes) will give 
invited talks.

The 5th international workshop GBR Graph-Based Representation in 
Pattern Recognition will also take place in Poitiers, from the April 
11th to April 13th.
Wednesday April 13th a commun session we will organized with Achille 
Braquelaire LaBRI Bordeaux France) as Invited Speaker.

Following DGCI, the Morpho Math conference ISMM will take place in 
Paris (from 18 to 20 April).

See our main page : http://www.tc18.org/ to go back to all 
these information.

Do not forget to register to DGCI conference!

2. Educational and Image/code data base

Educational:
The structure is defined on the web page but a very few information is still
available... Do not hesitate to send us some documents to add: 
transparencies, lectures, etc.

Data Sets:
A lot of  grayscale 3D images  are now available on the web site.

Code:
The structure of  the code web page has  been improved (it is ordered 
following the subfields of the educational page) and a lot of new 
entries has been inserted since the last newsletter.

  -  MVox  :  a  3d  volumetric data   visualizer with some  homotopic
  thinning algorithms [Sebastien Fourey]

  -  Program  to compute  optimal coefficients  of  3-D  chamfer norms
  [Celine Fouard and Gregoire Malandain]

  - Fast Digital Plane Recognition [Y.  Gerard, I. Debled-Rennesson and
  P. Zimmermann]

  - Library providing a type to  memorize and manipulate bitmap images
  of dimension 2 to 4 [Edouard Thiel]

  - LibLongVol, a simple and powerful library  to manipulate 3D images
  in which voxel are long integers [David Coeurjolly]

  - 3D Squared Euclidean Distance Transform in optimal time (using the
  Liblongvol library) [David Coeurjolly]


3. Miscellaneous

May be some of you have attended the IWCIA conference in Aukland (New 
Zealand) (1-3 December 2004) organized by Reinhard Klette at the 
University of Auckland.
They certainly enjoyed the conference... and the excursion...

A new book in  the   Discrete Geometry  field is available 
"Digital Geometry, geometric   methods for  digital picture 
analysis"  (Morgan Kaufman, 2004 (see  the Educational web  page for 
further information) by Reinhard Klette and Azriel Rosenfeld.   This 
material will probably become an essential reading for both students 
and researchers.

Have a nice end of 2004; Happy New Year for 2005.

We hope to see you in Poitiers.

December 9th -   Annick and David.
