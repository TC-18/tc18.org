DGCI'2006 is  the 13th in  the series of international  conferences on
Discrete  Geometry  for  Computer  Imagery.   The  aim  is  to  gather
researchers in  discrete geometry and topology,  discrete models, with
applications in image analysis and image synthesis.

Discrete  geometry plays  an expanding  role  in the  fields of  shape
modelling,  image  synthesis,  and  image  analysis.   It  deals  with
topological  and   geometric  definitions  of   digitized  objects  or
digitized  images and  provides both  a theoretical  and computational
framework for computer imaging.

This  edition of  DGCI follows  the  successful 2005  edition held  in
Poitiers,  France.   It  is  organized  by  the  Department  of  Image
Processing and Computer Graphics (Institute of Informatics, University
of Szeged).  It will take place  in Szeged, Hungary from October 25 to
October 27, 2006.
The  conference  will  offer   invited  talks,  lectures  on  selected
articles, presentations of  selected posters, and demonstrations.  The
proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer Verlag, in
the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
