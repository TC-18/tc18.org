ABSTRACT = {Chamfer distances are widely used in image analysis and many 
authors have investigated the computation of optimal chamfer mask 
coefficients. Unfortunately, these methods are not systematized: 
calculations have to be conducted manually for every mask size or image 
anisotropy. Since image acquisition (e.g. medical imaging) can lead to 
discrete anisotropic grids with unpredictable anisotropy value, 
automated calculation of chamfer mask coefficients becomes mandatory for 
e cient distance map computations. This article presents an automatic 
construction for chamfer masks of arbitrary sizes. This allows, first, 
to derive analytically the relative error with respect to the Euclidean 
distance, in any 3-D anisotropic lattice, and second, to compute optimal 
chamfer coefficients. In addition, the resulting chamfer map verifies 
discrete norm conditions.}

    in Chamfer masks both in two- and in three-dimensional anisotropic
    spaces. For these errors, closed forms are given that can be
    related to the Chamfer mask geometry.  Thanks to these calculation,
    it can be obsrved that the usual Chamfer masks ({\em i.e.} 3x3x3 or
    5x5x5) have an inhomogeneously distributed error. Moreover, it
    allows us to design dedicated Chamfer masks by controlling either
    the complexity of the computation of the distance map (or
    equivalently the number of vectors in the mask), or the error of
    the mask in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ or in $\mathbb{Z}^3$.  Last, since
    Chamfer distances are usually computed with integer weights (and
    approximate the Euclidean distance up to a multiplicative factor),
    we demonstrate that the knowledge of the local errors allows a very
    efficient computation of these weights.},
