We are all familiar with the convex hull of an object. It is easy to
compute and the convex deficiencies can be a good help in describing the
shape. It would be very nice to have a useful algorithm for the convex
scull, which would enable the identification and use of the protrusions
for shape description.

The convex skull of a shape is the largest enclosed convex subset of the
shape. There exists an algorithm for computing the exact convex skull,
but it is O(n^7) where n is the number of edge points [1]. There also
exists a fast but bad approximation [1], which is useful for small
shapes but as essentially computes the largest inscribed octagon the
approximation can be very bad for large shapes. How to compute a good
approximation that is not too time consuming? Or even better, an exact
algorithm that is less than O(n^7).
