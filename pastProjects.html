                                During a snowfall, the snow crystals accumulate on the ground and gradually form a complex porous medium constituted of air, water vapor, ice and sometimes liquid water. This ground-lying snow transforms with time, depending on the physical parameters of the environment. This process, called metamorphism, can be divided into three main types of metamorphisms: the wet snow metamorphism, the isothermal metamorphism, and the temperature gradient (TG) metamorphism. In polar or mountainous conditions, these processes are followed by compaction of snow into ice under the load of the upper snow layers. Although the general effects of theses various types of metamorphism are roughly well-known, the physical mechanisms that lead to these transformations are not perfectly well understood. A better microscale simulation of these mechanisms would help to understand how snow changes its microstructure depending on the applied physical conditions and has major impacts on the studies of snow behavior and properties at larger scale.

                                The main purpose of this project is to provide efficient computational tools to study the snow metamorphism from 3D images of real snow microstructures acquired using X-ray tomography techniques. In particular, our work will focus on the development of 3D image-based numerical models that can simulate the shape evolution of the snow microstructure during its metamorphism. It will be completed by other tools designed to extract physical properties from the computed microstructures.
                                
                                The resolution of these problems requires a strong interaction between three disciplines: Snow Physics, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, which justifies the collaboration between the CEN, the LAMA and the LIRIS respectively. To achieve our objectives, three key points are required: obtaining 3D images of snow microstructures, representing the digital objects with adapted data structures in order to perform numerical measurements, and evolving the digital objects according to physical laws. Last but not least, experimental validations of the proposed tools and models are required. The project is composed of the four following tasks:
                                <ul>

                                   <li>Snow metamorphism modelling</li>
                                    <li>HP digital toolbox for volumetric and surface analysis</li>
                                    <li>Dynamic digital structures for evolving regions</li>
                                    <li>Physical rendering for snow radiative transfer</li>

                                </ul>
                                
                                This project has several impacts in Snow Physics, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. The main results will be made available to the scientific community using the DGtal open source library.

                                In numerous fields (e.g., material sciences, medical imaging), non-invasive acquisition
                                devices such as
                                magnetic resonance, X-ray tomography or microtomography are required for observation,
                                measurements or
                                diagnostic aids. These acquisition devices usually generate volumic data, i.e., 3D
                                images, composed of
                                regularly spaced data in a cuboidal domain. 3D volumes come from the segmentation of
                                such 3D images. They
                                can also be generated from scientific modeling because numerous simulation schemes rely
                                on the regularity
                                of the data support.
                                PARADIS is a project about geometry of 3D volume boundaries, called digital surfaces.
                                Keeping the digital
                                nature of the data is an advantage to do integer-only and exact computations, to perform
                                constructive
                                solid geometry operations, or to use efficient spatial data structures. A drawback is
                                its poor geometry: a
                                digital surface is only made up of quadrangular surface elements whose normal vector is
                                parallel to one
                                axis, whatever the resolution. Many high-level tasks in computer graphics, computer
                                vision and 3D image
                                analysis require a richer geometry, e.g., rendering, surface deformation for physical
                                simulation or
                                tracking, precise geometric measurements. To perform relevant geometric tasks and to
                                benefit from the
                                above-mentioned advantages in the same time, one need to enhance the geometry of digital
                                surfaces by
                                estimating extra information for each surface element. This project focuses on
                                estimations of local and
                                first-order geometric quantities such as normal vector direction. It aims at providing
                                accurate and
                                parameter-free estimators based on a surface patch with adaptive size around each
                                surface element. Since
                                we are looking for first-order estimations, the patch will be typically a piece of
                                digital plane that
                                locally fits the digital surface.
                                A challenge is to cover the whole digital surface by maximal pieces of digital plane.
                                Such a cover not
                                only provides a normal vector field, but may also provide, if computed for several
                                subsampled versions of
                                the input 3D volume, a way of determining the scale at which noise is unlikely: a high
                                number of very
                                small digital plane segments indicate noise, whereas smooth parts are decomposed into a
                                smaller set of
                                larger segments. What is challenging is that there is a combinatorial explosion of
                                maximal pieces of
                                digital plane and that among them, not all are tangent to the digital surface.
                                An opportunity to make a breakth rough regarding this issue is to consider the recent
                                development of
                                plane-probing algorithms, proposed by the principal investigator and his collaborators.
                                These algorithms
                                allow to decide on-the-fly how to probe the digital surface and make grow a digital
                                plane segment, which
                                is tangent by construction. The growth direction is given by both arithmetic and
                                geometric properties.
                                PARADIS aims at analyzing digital surfaces with the help of plane-probing algorithms.
                                We expect a positive impact in computer graphics, computer vision and 3D image analysis
                                because the
                                above-mentioned high-level tasks and many others, such as primitive extraction or scene
                                understanding,
                                rely on the quality of normal estimation. In addition, since many 3D images may be
                                degraded with noise,
                                especially in medical imaging, noise detection is a crucial task, which may become a key
                                step of 3D image
                                processing pipelines.
