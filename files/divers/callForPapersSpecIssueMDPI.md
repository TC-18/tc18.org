Dear colleagues:

We would like to draw your attention to a special issue on
**"Computational Algebraic Topology and Neural Networks in Computer
Vision"** in the journal "MDPI Mathematics"(JCR Q1) that we (Matthias
Zeppelzauer and Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz) are co-editing.

This Special Issue collects papers with the aim of developing novel
topology-based approaches for computer vision and/or applying
topology-based approaches to improve the current state-of-the-art in
machine learning and computer vision. Of special interest are papers
that address the challenge of integrating topology as the main tool in
neural networks to computer vision applications.

Paper submitted to the SI should be of high quality, originality, and
significance, and must not consist of overviews of the authors'
previously published work. Nevertheless, in case the paper is based on
a conference contribution it must contain at least 30% novelty
compared to the conference paper. The review process starts as soon as
the paper is submitted.

The deadline is June 20, 2020. The journal is open access. We will
invite the five most promising papers submitted without charge.
Please, contact the guest co-editors (Matthias
Matthias.Zeppelzauer@fhstp.ac.at and Rocio rogodi@us.es) before
submitting the paper.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. Looking
forward to your submission.
