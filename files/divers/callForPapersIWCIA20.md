- Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities (such as "pinched digital surfaces")
 
- Homotopy of digital manifolds; Thinning algorithms and skeletons
 
- Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries
 
- Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors
 
- Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching
 
- Computational geometry and imaging sciences
 
- Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis
 
- Image representation, segmentation, grouping, and reconstruction
 
- Processing "very large" digital pictures; Methods for image compression
 
- Parallel architectures and algorithms
 
- Fuzzy and stochastic image analysis
 
- Discrete tomography
 
- Grammars and models for image or scene analysis and recognition; Cellular automata
 
- Mathematical morphology and image analysis
 
- Applications in medical imaging, biometrics, computer vision, image understanding, robotics, metrology, and others
