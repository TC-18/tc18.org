================================================ 


1. New TC18 site refresh with new framework and host change
-------------------------------------------------

The previous TC18 web site was suffering of major problem due to an
recent server update imposing us the use of an SSL connection
associated to an invalid certificate. Depending of the web browser,
users should have to add an exception to visit to the  TC18 web
site (else the access was not possible).

To resolve this issue, we first make hosted the site on GitHub
server. A refresh of the website was also done by using a new
responsive design (based on Bootstrap framework, special thanks to
Jean-Luc Husson from the MMI department for the suggestion and given
examples). So now the display is responsive and is automatically
adapted to the new display.  As for the previous site, new updates are
always possible for all GitHub users. A new description file show
indication to guide you and tp explain how to contribute and edit the
site. Moreover on each page a simple link give you access on the
source page allowing to edit online the page.





2. New member adds from the ISMM conference and list update. 
---------------------------------------------------------

After the presentation of the TC on previous ISMM conference by
Michael Wilkinson, with the help of the Jesús Angulo (previous chair
of ISMM 2017), we imported all the authors and reviewers and send them
invitations to join TC18. We are happy to welcome new members and to
invite them to participate to the evolution this TC. 

Together with the new inclusion members, the current list was updated
by correcting obsolete web page or new affiliations. Don't hesitate to
contact the chairs of this list (inscriptions@tc18.org) if you detect
that your affiliation are not correct or if link is broken.


In parallel to the official members list, we also construct a new TC18
GitHub team (https://github.com/TC-18) which allows to better identify
and define different tasks useful to apply more dynamism in the
project. We hope that it will facilitate different contributions and
interaction from both DG and MM fields.

All member are welcome to contribute with propositions or editions. You
can also request to be added to the GitHub team by contacting us
on  inscriptions@tc18.org. 





3. Past and forthcoming events with deadlines (with ISMM and DGCI)
--------------------------------------------------------


DGCI 2017 report:
-----------------
The 20th IAPR International Conference on Discrete Geometry for
Computer Imagery, DGCI 2017, was held in Vienna, Austria, from 19 to
21 September 2017. This conference was organized by Walter
G. Kropatsch, Nicole M. Artner and Ines Janusch from the Pattern
Recognition and Image Processing Group at TU Wien, Austria.

The DGCI 2017 conference attracted 48 researchers. The scientific
program consisted in 3 invited talks, 18 oral and 10 poster
presentations during 3 days. 

Three keynote speeches were given:
- Helmut Pottmann (TU Wien, Austria):  “Freeform Architecture and Discrete Differential Geometry”.
- Michael Wilkinson (University of Groningen, The Netherlands): “A guided tour of connective morphology”
- Stephane Gaubert: Tropical and non-linear Perron-Frobenius methods for optimal control and zero-sum games

The full report is available online on the TC website: http://tc18.org/dgci/report_dgci2017.pdf

Other event:
------------
The 19th international Workshop on Combinatorial Image Analysis (IWCIA
18) will be held at Porto, Portugal and is chaired by Joao Manuel
R. S. Tavares (University of Porto, Portugal) with Reneta P. Barneva
(SUNY Fredonia, USA), Valentin E. Brimkov (SUNY Buffalo State, USA)
and Renato M. Natal Jorge (University of Porto, Portugal).  The actual
deadlines are over for standard papers but you can note the deadline
for short paper given October 20, 2018. Short paper authors will have
the possibility to submit a full version to special journal issue
devoted to the Workshop (see details here:
https://sites.google.com/view/iwcia18/papers).





4. List of DG/MM papers for 2017 and the first half of 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------

As usual, you will find enclosed to this email the list of DG and MM
papers in major journal papers for 2017 and the first half of 2018.
If you think that we forgot some journals or that some should not
appear in this list, don't hesitate to let us know. Similarly, if we
forgot some references, let us know.





5. News of current  RRPR workshop.
----------------------------------

In few weeks will hold the second workshop on Reproducible Research in
Pattern Recognition (in conjonction with ICPR at Beijing, August
20th). An special invited talk presented by Miguel Colom of the IPOL
team will open the workshop including a tutorial to construct online
demonstration without writing new code. You are welcome to assist to
this workshop in particular if you already plane to come to ICPR.

The workshop also proposed to handle the reproducible label (see more details: https://rrpr2018.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/5)
