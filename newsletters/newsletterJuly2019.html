1. News for next event organisation; DGCI + ISMM
-------------------------------------------------

After the call for proposal of the next DGCI+ISMM event, the steering
committees are happy to announce that the Upsalla proposal (Sweden)
was retained to organize this new event that will be held in the Fall
2020 (December 10-13, date to be confirmed). The event will be chaired by
Filip Malmberg (main chair), Nataša Sladoje (program chair) and Joakim
Lindblad (Organization Chair). The organisation team is completed by
advisors (Robin Strand, Ingela Nyström​), honorary chair (Gunilla
Borgefors, Christer Kiselman) and assistant (Johan Öfverstedt).


2. DGCI and ISMM reports
-------------------------

DGCI report:
------------

The 21th IAPR International Conference on Discrete Geometry for
Computer Imagery, DGCI 2019, was held at ESIEE Paris, France, during
March 26-28 2019. This conference was organized by Michel Couprie,
Jean Cousty, Yukiko Kenmochi and Nabil Mustafa from the ESIEE Paris,
Université Paris-Est, France.  The DGCI 2019 conference attracted 76
researchers. The scientific program consisted in 3 invited talks, 26
oral and 10 posters presentations during 3 days.  This edition
attracted 50 submissions by authors from 20 countries: Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Iran, Italy,
Japan, The Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden,
UK, and USA


Three keynote speeches were given:

– Professor Alexandre Xavier Falcão, from University of Campinas, Brazil, on “The Role of Optimum Connectivity in Image Segmentation: Can the Algorithm Learn Object Information During the Process?”

– Professor Longin Jan Latecki, from Temple University, USA, on “Computing Maximum Weight Cliques with Local Search on Large Graphs with Application to Common Object Discovery”

– Professor János Pach, from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, on “The Blessing of Low Dimensionality”


The cest DGCI Student Paper was awarded to Loïc Crombez from Université Clérmont Auvergne - LIMOS, France,(with Guilherme D. da Fonseca and Yan Gérard), Efficient Algorithms to Test Digital Convexity



The full report will available online on the TC website (when ready): http://tc18.org/dgci/report_dgci2019.pdf




ISMM report:
------------

The 14th International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology (ISMM
2019), held in Saarbrücken, Germany, during July 8–10, 2019. The event
was organized by Bernhard Burgeth, Andreas Kleefeld, Benoît Naegel,
Nicolas Passat, and Benjamin Perret. The ISMM 2019 symposium attracted 70
researchers. The scientific program consisted in 3 invited talks, 24
oral and 16 posters presentations during 3 days.  This edition
attracted 54 submissions by authors from 11 countries: Austria, Brazil,
France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, UK,
and USA.

Three keynote speeches were given:

  - David Coeurjolly (LIRIS, CNRS, Lyon, France): Geometry Processing on Voxel Objects
  - Fred A. Hamprecht (IWR, HCI, Heidelberg, Germany): Watershed and Friends in the Age of Deep Learning
  - Boguslaw Obara (Durham University, Durham, UK): Combining Mathematical Morphology and the Hilbert Transform for Fully Automatic Nuclei Detection in Fluorescence Microscopy

5. Upcomming events
-------------------

A new tutorial on Digital Geometry has been accepted for presentation
during the ACPR2019. It will take place on the first day of the
conference(see https://www.acpr2019.org/tutorials.html and here
https://kerautret. github. io/ACPR19-DGPRTutorial): “Digital Geometry
in Pattern Recognition: Extracting Geometric Features with DGtal and
Applications” presented by Bertrand Kerautret (Université de Lyon 2,
France) and Jacques-Olivier Lachaud (Université Savoie Mont-Blanc,
France).  Also organized in conjunction with ACPR2019, a new workshop
is proposed including discrete geometry in its topics (submission
deadline 5 September): http://www.media.imit.chiba-u.jp/ipaMAC2019/.
