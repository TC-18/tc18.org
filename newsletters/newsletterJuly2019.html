1. News for next event organisation: DGCI + ISMM
------------------------------------------------

After the call for proposal of the next DGCI+ISMM event, the steering
committees are happy to announce that the Upsalla proposal (Sweden)
was retained to organize this new event that will be held in Fall
2020 (December 10-13, date to be confirmed). The event will be chaired by
Filip Malmberg (main chair), Nataša Sladoje (program chair) and Joakim
Lindblad (Organization Chair). The organisation team is completed by
advisors (Robin Strand, Ingela Nyström), honorary chair (Gunilla
Borgefors, Christer Kiselman) and assistant (Johan Öfverstedt).


2. DGCI and ISMM reports
------------------------

DGCI report
-----------

The 21th IAPR International Conference on Discrete Geometry for
Computer Imagery, DGCI 2019, was held at ESIEE Paris, France, during
March 26-28 2019. This conference was organized by Michel Couprie,
Jean Cousty, Yukiko Kenmochi and Nabil Mustafa from the ESIEE Paris,
Université Paris-Est, France.  The DGCI 2019 conference attracted 76
researchers. The scientific program consisted of 3 invited talks, 26
oral and 10 posters presentations during 3 days. This edition
attracted 50 submissions by authors from 20 countries: Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Iran, Italy,
Japan, The Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden,
UK, and USA

Three keynote speeches were given:

– Alexandre Xavier Falcão, from University of Campinas, Brazil, on “The Role of Optimum Connectivity in Image
Segmentation: Can the Algorithm Learn Object Information During the Process?”

– Longin Jan Latecki, from Temple University, USA, on “Computing Maximum Weight Cliques with Local Search on
Large Graphs with Application to Common Object Discovery”

– János Pach, from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, on “The Blessing of Low
Dimensionality”

The best DGCI Student Paper was awarded to Loïc Crombez from Université Clermont Auvergne - LIMOS, France,(with
Guilherme D. da Fonseca and Yan Gérard), Efficient Algorithms to Test Digital Convexity

The full report will available online on the TC website (when ready): http://tc18.org/dgci/report_dgci2019.pdf

ISMM report
-----------

The 14th International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology (ISMM
2019), was held in Saarbrücken, Germany, during July 8–10, 2019. The event
was organized by Bernhard Burgeth, Andreas Kleefeld, Benoît Naegel,
Nicolas Passat, and Benjamin Perret. The ISMM 2019 symposium attracted 70
researchers. The scientific program consisted of 3 invited talks, 24
oral and 16 posters presentations during 3 days. This edition
attracted 54 submissions by authors from 16 countries: Austria, Brazil,
France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, The Netherlands, Pakistan, Serbia,
South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Tunisia, UK, and USA.
Three keynote speeches were given:

- David Coeurjolly (LIRIS, CNRS, Lyon, France): Geometry Processing on Voxel Objects
- Fred A. Hamprecht (IWR, HCI, Heidelberg, Germany): Watershed and Friends in the Age of Deep Learning
- Boguslaw Obara (Durham University, Durham, UK): Combining Mathematical Morphology and the Hilbert Transform for Fully
Automatic Nuclei Detection in Fluorescence Microscopy

-----------------------------------------------------------

As usual, you will on the following link the list of DG and MM
papers in major journal for 2018 and the first half of 2019.
If you think that we forgot some papers or some others should not
appear in this list, don't hesitate to let us know. Do the same for
missing references too.

5. Upcoming events and other
-----------------------------

A new tutorial on Digital Geometry has been accepted for presentation
during the ACPR2019. It will take place on the first day of the
conference (see https://www.acpr2019.org/tutorials.html and here
https://kerautret.github.io/ACPR19-DGPRTutorial): “Digital Geometry
in Pattern Recognition: Extracting Geometric Features with DGtal and
Applications” presented by Bertrand Kerautret (Université de Lyon 2,
France) and Jacques-Olivier Lachaud (Université Savoie Mont-Blanc,
France). Also organized in conjunction with ACPR2019, a new workshop
is proposed including discrete geometry in its topics (submission
deadline 5 September): http://www.media.imit.chiba-u.jp/ipaMAC2019/.

For people interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning (CVML)
an new email list for scientific dissemination. See mail in this link: http://tc18.org/files/mailListCVML.txt



6. New content of TC18 website
------------------------------

As announced during the TC18 presentations of DGCI a ISMM, a new
Project section was added to the site. The aim of this page is to
provide an overview of existing active (or past) projects with
relation to DG and MM (national, European or international) and also
to add proposition of new collaborations. If you want to add a
project, you can just send us an email with project information or
directly apply a Pull Request on this repository. Moreover, this page
can also be used to announce new project construction plan and help to
facilitate partnership.

see:
http://tc18.org/projects.html

The front page of the main site was also improved with a new twitter
feed and new account created.
Don't hesitate to follow us on @IAPR_TC18.

By the way, if you are interested in sharing the twitter animation,
please contact us! (we are free to add new roles like "communication
board member")
