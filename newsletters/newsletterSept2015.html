3. List of DG papers for 2014 and the first half of 2015

With a little bit of delay, you will find enclosed to this email the
list of DG papers in major journal papers for 2014 and the first half of
2015.  
The journal papers we considered are the following:
- Pattern Recognition
- Pattern Recognition Letters
- Image and Vision Computing
- Computer Vision and Image Understanding
- Discrete Applied Mathematics
- IEEE PAMI
- Discrete and Computational Geometry
- Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision
- Theoretical Computer Science
- Image Processing Online

If you think that we forgot some journals or that some should not appear
in this list, don't hesitate to let us know. Similarly, if we forgot
some references, let us know.  

4. Miscellaneous
- Announces: the TC18 mailing list can be used to announce job
positions, PhD defenses, new books, and upcoming events for the
community. If you wish to send a message, please contact us beforehand.   
- Website: the TC18 Gallery is still quite poor, and we need your help
to enrich it. Thus, if you have nice images from recent results, do not
hesitate to contact us !
