"IAPR Newsletter on TC18"  (diffused in volume 40 number 2, April 2018)
=============================================================================


The IAPR TC18 main objective is to gather research activities around
Discrete Geometry (DG) and recently from last ICPR around Mathematical
Morphology (MM). Conferences on these domains (especially DGCI and
ISMM) together with the TC website offer these opportunities.  This
one contains major reference works on DG and MM, along with data sets
and code repositories. Following the TC18 session of the main conferences,
the open problems along with their code/data resources are updated and
new implementations are forked from the new TC18 GitHub repository
(https://github.com/TC-18).

Related to TC18, the second workshop on Reproducible Research in
Pattern Recognition (RRPR) will be organized in conjunction with the
next edition of ICPR in Beijing (website: https://rrpr2018.sciencesconf.org).
A special focus on Discrete Geometry and Mathematical Morphology is proposed.
The ICPR authors can submit companion papers to focus on the reproducibility
aspect of their work (implementation details of the algorithms, parameter
influence, potential limitations, etc). The authors of ICPR papers are
also invited to submit their source code in order to obtain a "Reproducible Label"
badge that can be attached to the camera ready version. See more details here:
https://rrpr2018.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/5. This workshop
will be also the opportunity to present or discover new ways to
perform Reproducible Research in the field of Pattern Recognition, for
instance, with the presentation/tutorial of automatic demonstration
systems, as the demo system of the IPOL journal (http://www.ipol.im)

. You can follow the Twitter account for more news (@RRPR_Workshop).

After this workshop, the main events are coming with the next call for
paper of DGCI which will take place at ESIEE Paris in spring 2019
followed by ISMM at Munich.

TC18 chairs B. Kerautret and M. Wilkinson with board members
