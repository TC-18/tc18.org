1. Happy New Year 2006 !

We expect for you some nice and new results in discrete geometry that
you will present at the next DGCI conference in Szeged.


2. 13th DGCI conference in Szeged (Hungaria) - October 25-27, 2006

Deadline for submission was on April 3, 2006. Do not miss it.

Acceptance notification will be sent on 3th June 2006.

See : http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/dgci/


3. Educational  web pages

The  repository  contains  near 30 slide/material  entries  on various
topics (many thanks to Reinhard Klette (Auckland, NZ) who allows us to
index his web pages).

Many  subfields are not covered  yet by documents,  so  if you want to
submit  your  own material, just contact   us using  the tc18@cb.uu.se
email address.

We also would   like to  insist    on the Reference  section  on  each
subfield. The idea is to organize and comment the main references (key
articles) for each topic.

We would need:

  - 2  or more persons per   subfield to organize  and collect  of the
  references (a kind of committee)

  - contributors to submit references with comments to the committees.

Thanks in advance for your contributions.
