================================================ 


1. New TC18 site refresh with new framework and host change
-------------------------------------------------

The previous TC18 web site was suffering of major problem due to a
recent server update imposing the use of a SSL connection
associated to an invalid certificate. Depending of the web browser,
users should have to add an exception to visit the TC18 web
site (otherwise the access was not possible). 

To solve this issue, we first make the site hosted on a GitHub
server. A refresh of the website was also done by using a new
responsive design (based on Bootstrap framework, special thanks to
Jean-Luc Husson of the MMI department from the IUT of Saint Dié des
Vosges for the suggestion and the provided examples). So now the
display is responsive and it is automatically adapted to the new
display. As for the previous site, new updates are always possible for
all GitHub users. A new description file guides you and explains how
to contribute and edit the site. Moreover on each page a simple link
gives the access to the source page allowing the online editing.

Even if the host change, the website url remains the same:

https://tc18.org




 
2. New member addition from the ISMM conference and list update.
---------------------------------------------------------


After the presentation of the TC at the previous ISMM conference by
Michael Wilkinson, with the help of the Jesús Angulo (previous chair
of ISMM 2017), we imported all the authors and reviewers and send them
invitations to join TC18. We are happy to welcome new members and to
invite them to participate to the evolution of this TC.

Together with the new inclusion members, the current list was updated
by correcting obsolete web page or new affiliations. Don't hesitate to
contact the chairs of this list (inscriptions@tc18.org) if you realize
that your affiliation is not correct or if the link does not work.

In parallel to the official members list, we also construct a new TC18
GitHub team (https://github.com/TC-18) which allows to better identify
and define different tasks useful to apply more dynamism in the
project. We hope that it will facilitate various contributions and
interactions from both DG and MM fields.


All member are welcome to contribute with suggestions or editions. You
can also request to be added to the GitHub team by contacting us
on  inscriptions@tc18.org. 





3. Past and forthcoming events with deadlines (with ISMM and DGCI)
--------------------------------------------------------


DGCI 2017 report:
-----------------
The 20th IAPR International Conference on Discrete Geometry for
Computer Imagery, DGCI 2017, was held in Vienna, Austria, from 19 to
21 September 2017. This conference was organized by Walter
G. Kropatsch, Nicole M. Artner and Ines Janusch from the Pattern
Recognition and Image Processing Group at TU Wien, Austria.

The DGCI 2017 conference attracted 48 researchers. The scientific
program consisted in 3 invited talks, 18 oral and 10 poster
presentations during 3 days. 

Three keynote speeches were given:
- Helmut Pottmann (TU Wien, Austria):  “Freeform Architecture and Discrete Differential Geometry”.
- Michael Wilkinson (University of Groningen, The Netherlands): “A guided tour of connective morphology”
- Stephane Gaubert: Tropical and non-linear Perron-Frobenius methods for optimal control and zero-sum games

The full report is available online on the TC website: http://tc18.org/dgci/report_dgci2017.pdf

Other event:
------------
The 19th international Workshop on Combinatorial Image Analysis (IWCIA

the deadline for standard papers is expired, but this is not the case
for short paper (postponed till October 20, 2018). Short paper authors will have
the possibility to submit a full version to the special journal issue
devoted to the Workshop (see details here:
https://sites.google.com/view/iwcia18/papers).

As usual, you will on the following link the list of DG and MM
papers in major journal for 2017 and the first half of 2018.
If you think that we forgot some papers or some others should not
appear in this list, don't hesitate to let us know. Do the same for
missing references too.

5. News of current RRPR workshop.
----------------------------------


In few weeks it will take place the second workshop on Reproducible
Research in Pattern Recognition (in conjunction with ICPR at Beijing,
August 20th). A special invited talk presented by Miguel Colom of the
IPOL team will open the workshop with a talk deadling with the future
of the ipol Journal. Note also that a partical session to construct
online demonstration without writing new code is proposed in the
aftermoon. You are welcome to assist to this workshop in particular if
you already plane to come to ICPR.

The workshop also proposed to handle the reproducible label (see more details: https://rrpr2018.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/5)
