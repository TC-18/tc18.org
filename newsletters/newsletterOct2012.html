=====================================================

1) New TC18 board to be appointed: looking for candidates
---------------------------------------------------------

The current board of TC18 (Ullrich Koethe, Guillaume Damiand, and
Joost Batenburg) has almost completed two terms of service (i.e. four
years in total). According to IAPR rules, the same board can serve at
most two terms, so a new board has to be appointed, either at ICPR in
Japan next month, or at DGCI 2013 in Sevilla at the latest.

Since 2002, the Technical Committee 18 of the IAPR tries to promote
interactions and collaboration between researchers working on discrete
geometry. The main activities concern:
  - Information to the community via newsletters and the mailing list
  - A web site with material (educational, software, data sets,
    challenges,...)
  - Involved in the DGCI Steering Committee and the DGCI Best Student
    Paper Award
  - Participation in the organization of scientific exchange
    (workshops, special issues)

We are seeking volunteers for this important community service. If you
would like to nominate someone or are interested yourself, please let
us know as soon as possible.

2) DGCI 2013 in Sevilla
------------------------

As you certainly know, the next DGCI takes place on
20-22 March 2013 in Sevilla, Spain.

    Email:   dgci2013@us.es
    Website: http://dgci2013.us.es/

    Deadline for early registration: 4 February 2013;

    Some useful links:

     - Registration: http://dgci2013.us.es/registration.php
     - Accommodations: http://dgci2013.us.es/accommodation.php

    The Scientific Program is not yet available, as the reviewing
    period is just about to end.

3) Call for Proposals: DGCI 2014 in your Department ?
-----------------------------------------------------

   In Sevilla, the DGCI Steering Committee will decide and announce the
   location of the next DGCI edition. Before that, proposals should be
   set up and the TC18 aims at helping researchers with this step.
   Please have a look to the following appendix written by the DGCI
   Steering Committee for details. You can also find information on past
   editions and detailed guidelines for DGCI organization here:
   http://www.tc18.org/events.html#dgci

   If we follow the traditional rhythm, DGCI 2014 should be in France,
   but good proposals from other countries will also be considered.
   Please let us know if you are interested in organizing the next
   DGCI.


4) Springer LNCS 7346: "Applications of Discrete Geometry and
   Mathematical Morphology"
----------------------------------------------------------

A new book with selected papers on "Applications of Discrete Geometry
and Mathematical Morphology" (edited by Ullrich Köthe, Annick
Montanvert and Pierre Soille) has recently appeared as volume 7346 of
Springer's LNCS series. The volume presents greatly enhanced and
thoroughly reviewed versions of selected contributions from the WADGMM
workshop that was held in Istanbul 2010 (prior to ICPR). The papers
nicely reflect the diversity of discrete geometry and mathematical
morphology applications and offer a variety of useful tools for the
image analysis practitioner. Here is the table of contents:

  * Connect the Dots: The Reconstruction of Region Boundaries from
    Contour Sampling Points
    Peer Stelldinger
  * Digital Shape Analysis with Maximal Segments
    Jacques-Olivier Lachaud
  * Discrete Curvature Estimation Methods for Triangulated Surfaces
    Mohammed Mostefa Mesmoudi, Leila De Floriani and Paola Magillo
  * On Morphological Hierarchical Representations for Image Processing
    and Spatial Data Clustering
    Pierre Soille and Laurent Najman
  * Radial Moment Invariants for Attribute Filtering in 3D
    Fred N. Kiwanuka and Michael H. F. Wilkinson
  * Volumetric Analysis of Digital Objects Using Distance
    Transformation: Performance Issues and Extensions
    David Coeurjolly
  * Geometric Analysis of 3D Electron Microscopy Data
    Ullrich Köthe, Björn Andres, Thorben Kröger and Fred Hamprecht
  * Machine Learning as a Preprocessing Phase in Discrete Tomography
    Mihály Gara, Tamás Sámuel Tasi and Péter Balázs
  * Fast Planarity Estimation and Region Growing on GPU
    Michaël Heyvaert and Peter Veelaert
  * Writing Reusable Digital Topology Algorithms in a Generic Image
    Processing Framework
    Roland Levillain, Thierry Géraud and Laurent Najman
  * A New Image-Mining Technique for Automation of Parkinson’s Disease
    Research
    Igor Gurevich, Artem Myagkov and Vera Yashina

------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines for DGCI organization and on how to prepare a DGCI proposal

DGCI editions
=============

DGCI is a IAPR conference, so DGCI follows most of the IAPR rules.
Information on the past editions can be found on: http://www.tc18.org

Submission of proposals to organize a DGCI conference
=====================================================

The proposal must contain information on:

- the venue (city and conference hall), main access and transportation
  alternatives, and accommodation;

- the organizing University, laboratory/department, and research team;

- proposed dates (conference dates and deadlines);

- financial plan, including preliminary registration fees;

- program outline, scientific policy, suggestions for invited speakers;

- conference, program, and other chairs;

- any other important information.

Proposals should be sent to the Steering Committee members
(sc-dgci@tc18.org), at least two weeks before the upcoming DGCI. The
winning proposal for the next DGCI is selected by the Steering
Committee during the current one, and announced to the participants
before the end of the conference.

DGCI committees
===============

Steering committee: It is composed of a few permanent people completed
by the main organisers of several previous DGCIs (one for each) and by
the chair (or vice-chair) of TC18-IAPR. It is headed by a president
who is a main contact for the current organising committee.

Organising committees: It is already well defined during the proposal
to organise. It must prepare and send the call for paper, complete the
Program Committee and the Reviewing Committee (see Reviewing Process),
organise the reviewing process following DGCI rules, prepare the
Proceedings (see below), and finally the conference itself. These
steps are processed in relation with the Steering Committee.


Organisation
============

DGCI is a three day event. Usually, there is one invited lecturer per
day. The whole conference is organised as single track, with one or
two poster sessions. The poster sessions should be considered as
regular sessions, that is, they should not be held at the same time as
oral sessions.  The organisers should provide a meeting place for the
Steering Committee the day before the main social event of the
conference.  The organisers should also provide a meeting place and
time for the TC18 members.


Frequency
=========

DGCI is organised every 18 months. This frequency assures that the
scientific community can provide new results, while a PhD student can
attend two editions. It also provides some flexibility for the
organizers to find convenient dates.  Consequently next DGCI (the
18th) should be organised during autumn 2014.


Other conferences
=================

When deciding the DGCI dates, information about related conferences,
for example ISMM, IWCIA, must be taken into account. Information on
dates should be acquired by early exchanges between Steering Committee
or organizers.


Venue
=====

The current tradition is to hold every other DGCI in France and to
hold the others outside France. The Spring DGCIs have been held in
France and the Autumn ones outside. Of course, the field of interest
of IAPR-TC18 is worldwide, not limited to Europe.


Costs
=====

The main purpose of DGCI is to gather together researchers active in
the field. Therefore travelling expenses and hotel costs must not be
prohibitive, and cheap alternative for participants on a limited
budget should be available. This is really more important than finding
a touristically attractive spot! It is also important to have low
registration fees for PhD students.


Proceedings and Special issues
==============================

All accepted papers should be treated equally in the DGCI proceedings,
independently of if the presentation is oral or poster. The choice of
presentation mode depends on suitability, rather than on perceived
quality. Proceedings are traditionally published by Springer Verlag in
the LNCS series. Extended versions of papers selected by the Steering
Committee can be published in special issues of one or two journals,
proposed by the organisers (of course contacts must be taken several
months in advance).


Reviewing process
=================

For each main DGCI topic, one or two persons are selected to form a
Program Committee. Each DGCI submission is reviewed by at least two
(usually three) members of the Reviewing Committee. Program Committee
members will provide reviewing reports for papers dealing with their
associated topics in case of disagreement between
reviewers. Submissions from the Organizing Committee are handled by an
independent process. During the main steps of the reviewing process,
the Steering Committee is kept informed. Items for useful discussions
are: acceptance rate, session topics, etc.
