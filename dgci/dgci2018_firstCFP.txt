Call for Papers
---------------

Discrete geometry plays an expanding role in the fields of shape modelling, image synthesis, and image analysis. It deals with topological and geometrical definitions of digitized objects or digitized images and provides both a theoretical and computational framework for computer imaging.

The aim of the DGCI conference is to bring together researchers, students and practitioners of discrete geometry, including discrete topology, geometric models, and mathematical morphology, to present and discuss new advances in these fields, be they purely theoretical developments or novel applications.

DGCI 2019 is organized by Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard-Monge (LIGM) at ESIEE Paris, France.

Together with the main event from 26th to 28th March, a one-day pre-conference event on Discrete Topology and Mathematical Morphology in honor of the retirement of Gilles Bertrand and a half-day post-conference event on Computational Geometry are also planned.

The main topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

      Models for Discrete Geometry,
      Discrete and Combinatorial Topology,
      Geometric Transforms,
      Discrete Shape Representation, Recognition and Analysis,
      Discrete Tomography,
      Mathematical Morphological Analysis,
      Discrete Modelling and Visualization,
      Discrete and Combinatorial Tools for Image Segmentation and Analysis.

Both theoretical and applicative contributions related to these topics are welcome.
