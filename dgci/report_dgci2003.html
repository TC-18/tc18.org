<h1>Report on DGCI'2003 in Napoli - TC18 main conference</h1>


<p>
The  11th International Conference  on  Discrete Geometry for Computer
Imagery Conference  (DGCI 2003)  was held  in Napoli,  November 19-21,
2003. The two previous editions of this series of conferences, started
in 1991,   held in  Uppsala-Sweden for  DGCI   December  2000  and  in
Bordeaux-France for  DGCI April 2002.  DGCI is now the main conference
of TC18-IAPR   (TC18 opened in   November 2002 on   discrete geometry:
<a href="http://www.tc18.org/">http://www.tc18.org/</a>).
</p>


<p>For this  edition in  Napoli,  Gabriella Sanniti  di Baja  was  the
general chair, seconded  for the program chair  by Stina  Svensson and
Ingela Nyström and for the   local committee by Salvatore  Piandedosi,
Silvia  Rossi and Luca Serino.   The organising  institutions were the
"Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Filosofici" (which provided wonderful
conference rooms),  and  the "Institute of Cybernetics  E. Caianiello"
(for  facilities  and  secretariat  work).   The  conference  has been
sponsored by   IAPR.  The three  days of  the conference  were rich of
scientific talks and exchanges and also full of nice social events.</p>

<p>Among    68  submitted papers,  23  have    been selected for  oral
presentations  and 26 for    poster sessions. The   conference brought
together 76 participants, coming from  16 countries. As usual at  DGCI
conferences,  there  was a low cost    registration for students.  Our
colleague Alberto Del Lungo (Dipartimento di Matematica, Siena, Italy)
who died suddenly in June 2003, was missing us.

<p>The talk  and poster sessions covered  some fascinating topics such
as discrete   geometry,  discrete   topology,  discrete  models    and
transforms, discrete surfaces  and volumes, morphology and  tomography
and various applications    to  image analysis,  image synthesis   and
visualisation.  The three invited speakers showed some important views
on their researches related to the  field of discrete imagery and then
they stimulated new ideas:  Prof. Isabelle Bloch, ENST, Paris, France,
gave a talk devoted  to "Fuzzy spatial relationships from mathematical
morphology for model-based pattern recognition and spatial reasoning";
Prof. Longin Jan Latecki, Temple University, Philadelphia, USA, gave a
precise and efficient process to work  on "Shape similarity and visual
part";  the  last invited talk  by Prof.   Ralph   Kopperman, the City
College   of New  York, New   York,   USA, about "Topological  Digital
Topology" was a great event for our community.
</p>



<p>All the participants to the conference  were happy to discuss about
their  researches on discrete geometry  and   many new ideas  appears?
that we will follow at the next DGCI.  Several wonderful social events
helped in these  discussions. The welcome  cocktail and  the (Italian)
pizza party were already perfect.  The  gala dinner was delightful and
we understood what an Italian dinner means: eight or even nine dishes,
each of them better than  the others! Everybody enjoys visiting Napoli
at free time or looking at the Vesuvio towards "Golfo di Napoli".  The
organisation  was very convenient as  the conference took place in the
city and  the weather was very  pleasant. As you have understood, this
DGCI'2003 was a success and a great event.<p>

<p>Proceedings of the conference are published by Springer in "Lecture
Notes in  Computer Science" #2886.   Two special issues  will come out
soon: one in  "Image  and Vision Computing  Journal" and  the other in
"Discrete Applied Mathematics Journal".  The next DGCI Conference will
held in   Poitiers,  France, on  April  13-15  2005,  organised by SIC
laboratory with Prof.   Eric Andrès at  General Chair.   Note that two
other events will be close  in location and  date: ? April 11-13 2005,
Poitiers,  5rd IAPR -TC-15 Workshop  on Graph-Based Representations in
Pattern Recognition;  ?   April    18-20 2005,  Paris,   International
Symposium     on     Mathematical        Morphology          See    <a
