-----------------------------------------

DGCI'2006 is the 13th in the series of international conferences on
Discrete Geometry for Computer Imagery. The aim is to gather researchers
in discrete geometry and topology, discrete models, with applications in
image analysis and image synthesis.

Discrete geometry plays an expanding role in the fields of shape
modelling, image synthesis, and image analysis. It deals with topological
and geometric definitions of digitized objects or digitized images and
provides both a theoretical and computational framework for computer
imaging.

This edition of DGCI follows the successful 2005 edition held in Poitiers,
France. DGCI 2006 is organized by the Department of Image Processing and
Computer Graphics (Institute of Informatics, University of Szeged). It
will take place in Szeged, Hungary from October 25 to October 27, 2006.

The conference will offer invited talks, lectures on selected articles,
presentations of selected posters, and demonstrations. The proceedings of
the conference will be published by Springer&#8217;s Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series.
