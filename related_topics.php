<h2>Relation with other TCs</h2>
 
<p> Discrete geometry and Mathematical Morphology are necessary in image analysis
and
shape representation in general. Some fields such as biomedical (TC9)
and remote sensing (TC7) applications can take advantage of progress
within discrete geometry. Combining the works coming from Computer
Vision and Image Understanding (TC4) and Graph based representations
(TC15) with Discrete Geometry and Mathematical Morphology will certainly lead to new results. </p>
 
<p> Several others topics have some common research
or applications with discrete geometry. Among them, we can emphasize : </p>
