        <li><b>Abstract</b>: 
          An ultrametric is a dual representation of a hierarchical clustering which is a classical machine learning method used when class
          labels are not known in advance. This approach is motivated theoretically by the fact that complex data such as social networks,
          power grids, actor networks, computer networks, cortical brain networks, language networks, and so forth, naturally show
          hierarchical organizations. Being able to construct high quality hierarchical representations of those data is thus an important step
          toward their analysis and their understanding. While hierarchical clustering is generally regarded as an unsupervised method, the
          use of supervision will greatly improve the quality of hierarchical methods and thus their capacity at automatically discovering
          meaningful organization in data. Therefore, this project aims at developing scalable methods for supervised learning of hierarchical
          clustering.

        <li><b>Abstract</b>: 
            Cardiovascular diseases and other blood vessels disorders increase in the world-wide scale and in particular
            in Occident. The evolution of computer science in researches investigating vascular networks has raised the
            interest in numerical reconstructing and understanding of those complex tree-like structures. The R-VESSEL-X
            project proposes original and robust developments of image analysis and machine learning algorithms
            integrating strong mathematical frameworks, e.g. digital geometry and topology, mathematical morphology, or
            graphs for reconstructing vessels of the liver beyond medical image content. Another objective of R-VESSEL-X
            is to diffuse research works in an open-source way, with the developments of plug-ins compatible with the
            ITK and VTK libraries largely popularized by the KITWARE company. This project will also include benchmarks
            composed of images, associated ground-truth and quality metrics, so that researchers and engineers evaluate
            their novel contributions. The consortium of R-VESSEL-X is composed of the following laboratories: Institut
            Pascal (coordinator, Le Puy-en-Velay/Clermont-Ferrand), LIRIS (Lyon), CReSTIC (Reims), working together with
            the KITWARE company (Lyon). This is a highly pluridisciplinary group composed of researchers in computer
            science-related topics (biomedical image processing, numerical simulation and analysis), applied mathematics
            (digital geometry and topology, mathematical morphology), working with medical doctors (radiologists,
            hepatologists) and young researchers and developers enrolled for the project.

          <li><b>Abstract</b>:
              In numerous fields (e.g., material sciences, medical imaging), non-invasive acquisition devices such as
              magnetic resonance, X-ray tomography or microtomography are required for observation, measurements or
              diagnostic aids. These acquisition devices usually generate volumic data, i.e., 3D images, composed of
              regularly spaced data in a cuboidal domain. 3D volumes come from the segmentation of such 3D images. They
              can also be generated from scientific modeling because numerous simulation schemes rely on the regularity
              of the data support.
              PARADIS is a project about geometry of 3D volume boundaries, called digital surfaces. Keeping the digital
              nature of the data is an advantage to do integer-only and exact computations, to perform constructive
              solid geometry operations, or to use efficient spatial data structures. A drawback is its poor geometry: a
              digital surface is only made up of quadrangular surface elements whose normal vector is parallel to one
              axis, whatever the resolution. Many high-level tasks in computer graphics, computer vision and 3D image
              analysis require a richer geometry, e.g., rendering, surface deformation for physical simulation or
              tracking, precise geometric measurements. To perform relevant geometric tasks and to benefit from the
              above-mentioned advantages in the same time, one need to enhance the geometry of digital surfaces by
              estimating extra information for each surface element. This project focuses on estimations of local and
              first-order geometric quantities such as normal vector direction. It aims at providing accurate and
              parameter-free estimators based on a surface patch with adaptive size around each surface element. Since
              we are looking for first-order estimations, the patch will be typically a piece of digital plane that
              locally fits the digital surface.
              A challenge is to cover the whole digital surface by maximal pieces of digital plane. Such a cover not
              only provides a normal vector field, but may also provide, if computed for several subsampled versions of
              the input 3D volume, a way of determining the scale at which noise is unlikely: a high number of very
              small digital plane segments indicate noise, whereas smooth parts are decomposed into a smaller set of
              larger segments. What is challenging is that there is a combinatorial explosion of maximal pieces of
              digital plane and that among them, not all are tangent to the digital surface.
              An opportunity to make a breakthrough regarding this issue is to consider the recent development of
              plane-probing algorithms, proposed by the principal investigator and his collaborators. These algorithms
              allow to decide on-the-fly how to probe the digital surface and make grow a digital plane segment, which
              is tangent by construction. The growth direction is given by both arithmetic and geometric properties.
              PARADIS aims at analyzing digital surfaces with the help of plane-probing algorithms.
              We expect a positive impact in computer graphics, computer vision and 3D image analysis because the
              above-mentioned high-level tasks and many others, such as primitive extraction or scene understanding,
              rely on the quality of normal estimation. In addition, since many 3D images may be degraded with noise,
              especially in medical imaging, noise detection is a crucial task, which may become a key step of 3D image
              processing pipelines.
