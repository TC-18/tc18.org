1. Presentation
---------------

	Voldraw consist of two programs ; both are used to create geometric figures. They generates :
		- a .vol file (see Vol(7))
		- a .sig file, which contains informations about the figures drawn in the vol file (area, volume, points, ...)

	In fact, only the syntaxes differs.
	
	- volgen 
		Volgen takes parameters in command line arguments.
	Exemple :
		volgen ellipsoid -a 10 -b 20 -c 2 -rx 45d -axis -parametric -s ellipsoid.sig -v ellipsoid.vol 
			
		See the man page for details.
		
	- voldraw
		Voldraw read a sig file and interprets it to create a vol file.
	Exemple :
		% cat foo.sig
		Ellipsoid e {
			rotation-X = 45d; /* this is a comment */
			params {
				a = 10;
				b = 20;
				c = 2;
			}
		} : axis, parametric;
		% voldraw -s ellipsoid.sig < foo
		

2. Compilation and installation
-------------------------------

	Just type :
		% ./configure && make && sudo make install
	Librairies and binaries will be installed in /usr/local/.
	Of course, you can set up a few things like prefix. To see what, juste type :
		% ./configure --help

	You MUST have installed libvol before. If libvol was installed in an unusual path, you should use --libvol-prefix=/some/path/to/libvol option of the configure script.

	If you do not pass the --with-voldraw option, then voldraw will not be built. If you do this, configure will assume that flex and bison (*) are installed. You can use the --lex and --yacc to customize this behaviour (but currently only flex and bison are supported).
	If you experiment problems with bison, try to use the --bison-hack at configure time.

	Uninstall :
		% make uninstall

	Doxygen documentation (for developpers only) :
		configure with --doc=yes option.
	

(*) The configure script assume that there is as yacc executable which only does bison -y $*.
	
3. Documentation
----------------

	There are manual pages for the programs that are shipped with voltools.
