    <h1>Proposal for new IAPR-TC: TC8 Discrete Geometry</h1>

      <i>presented at Governing Board meeting in ICPR 2002</i>
    </p>

    <h3 align=center>The scope</h3>

    <p>
      Discrete geometry plays an essential role in the field of image analysis, computer graphics, pattern recognition, shape modelling, computer vision, and document analysis. The main reason is, of course, that all data in the computer is unavoidably discrete. It has some well known and used concepts, new results regularly appear, and useful theorems and developments have still to be proposed. Discrete geometry provides both a theoretical and a computational framework for digital images.
    </p>

    <p>
      Discrete geometry is not a new discipline, but has appeared as a main field of computer imagery since more than 40 years. The foundations of discrete geometry are coming from the need of definitions and transformations based on the discrete space, rather than application of continuous and Euclidean notions. Well-known persons such as A. Rosenfeld, J-L. Pfaltz, G. Herman, E. Khalimsky, and T.Y. Kong were the precursors of these researches, and many others followed their ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      The development of efficient devices for image or video acquisition and processing, the increasing number of applications for both specific domains (medicine and biology, remote sensing, control, design) and common uses (DVD, Internet, HDTV, etc) are also important motivations and reasons to develop new results for the discrete space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, dealing with images implies developing discrete models to be used in the above mentioned fields. For this reason, discrete geometry plays an important role. Several more precise topics of research dealing directly with discrete spaces can be given such as topology, digitized objects, shape representation and understanding, geometrical transforms, metrics, coding and compression, curves, surfaces and volumes, shape recovery, image reconstruction, visualisation, and feature extraction.
    </p>

    <h3 align=center>The purpose</h3>

    <p>
      The aim of this IAPR-TC is to promote interactions and collaboration between researchers working on discrete geometry. Conferences and a TC web page will provide these opportunities. The topic is not covered by other IAPR-TCs, but will have links with some of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main conference will be the Discrete Geometry for Computer Imagery (DGCI) conference. DGCI is a series of conferences of which the first was held in 1991 in Strasbourg, and now held every 18 months. It is an international conference by its participants, its scientific committee and its location. Since the 6th DGCI (November 1996), proceedings have been published by Springer Verlag, in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The 11th DGCI will take place in Naples in November 2003.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants to DGCI are all potential members of the TC. Between 60 to 70 researchers have attended the conference frequently. In combination with each DGCI, a TC meeting will be held to give the possibility for the members to discuss the activity of the TC. An electronic newsletter will be sent regularly to the members.
    </p>

    <p>
      A web page is planned in order to access easily information on on-going research for researchers active within the field, as well as information on basic notions for researchers in related fields, or interested in starting an activity in discrete geometry.  Consequently, the web page will contain, more than the scope and purpose of the TC and the list of its members. There will also be: a list of main references and description of basic notions, a list of open problems, information on related conferences, a data base with test images and shapes, and announcements for Ph.D and post-doctoral positions. 
    </p>

    <p>
      By all the above, the TC will facilitate collaboration. Researchers will have the possibility to know quickly and precisely existing results, and how to contact the specialists of the various topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proposed chair and secretary is as follows:
    <dl>
      <dd>Chair: Prof. Annick MONTANVERT - LIS Laboratory - Grenoble France
      <dd>Secretary: Ph.D Stina SVENSSON - Centre for Image Analysis - Uppsala Sweden
    </dl>
